		<sub-topic>â€˜Coldâ€™ by Maroon 5 Is Sure Enough to Chill Your Bones!</sub-topic>
		
		I donâ€™t know about you guys but music is something that keeps me going. Music brings emotions to life. While we are talking about music, let us not forget the popular band Maroon 5. They have always been my favorite. And, now thereâ€™s one more reason to this.

Their newly released song â€˜Coldâ€™ is something which perfectly portrays the heart of any ex-lover that ever existed. Someone whom you thought would never be like this. But, all you can do is to laugh at your foolishness of believing that they actually loved you.

And, if you have come out of any noxious relationship, this is something just for you! Here take a look at the lyrics:
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I donâ€™t know you anymore
I donâ€™t understand why youâ€™re so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see thereâ€™s something going on
I donâ€™t understand why youâ€™re so cold
Watch the entire music video here!
And, if you too feel like you donâ€™t know your ex-lover anymore, sing along!

This song by Maroon 5 as already got more than 6 lakh views within 8 hours.

I am sure it is going to be a big hit!
