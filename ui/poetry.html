				   <p>A storm withheld, a sun which never sets,

				The love of nature and kindness at its best,

				The world knows how you quest,

				Oh Lord! you made a woman so perfect!

				 

				She plays so many roles,

				A daughter, a mother, a wife and best friend,

				Wanting always the peoples worry around her to end,

				Standing up for her rights and never gets bend,

				Oh Lord! you made a woman as a circle with no mend!

				 

				The highs and lows of her life,

				the criticism for having her own choice,

				what not she faced being a woman,

				Harassment, forced-marriages and domestic violence,

				Yet she smiles with all her broken pieces together,

				Oh Lord! You made a woman with no fear

				 

				She is out there to rule the world and make a mark,

				The history has already been embarked,

				The light she holds that forever sparks,

				She unwinds the passion to carve,

				Oh Lord! How you made a woman with so much love!

		<p>As board exams are approaching, the bar of mental pressure that teenagers face is soaring rather high. There are times when you get trapped with 				a lot of trauma due to exams and believe me, everyone has been there! Well, the major cause of worry is that the prime reason for depression 			among teenagers is due to #ExamFear.
