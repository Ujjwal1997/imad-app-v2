				   <p>With an IMDB rating of 7.6/10, Sanjay Gupta’s Kaabil starring Hrithik Roshan has hit the screens quite well.
				   Viewers have been getting mixed reviews, some bad and some good. The movie in all has quite a good plot, 
				   and the second half of the film is more action packed.</p><br>

				The Direction, the cinematography and the costumes are okay-ish. 
				The dress they wear however do not fit the storyline. The story says that both of them are blind, but in the movie,
				they have shown that two blind people are properly dressed and also wear makeup in the mornings.
				The production house had made sure that they focus only on the story, not keeping these small things in mind.

				<p>
				The storyline of the movie however is quite predictable.
				When it comes to acting, both Hrithik Roshan and Yani Gautam have given splendid performances indeed.
				You will surely love the way Yami Gautam has put in the efforts,
				and the expressions that she has depicted throughout the film are also lovely.

				The first part of the movie revolved around how these to meet and how they share their love and pain amongst each other. 
				The songs are quite classy, and they are truly blissful. 
				The second part of the film is however very predictable, as most of you might already have figured out by looking at the trailer.

				<br>
				Overall the performance of the actors was quite good. The movie was also good to watch, 
				however it is a one time watch. Nothing very much out of the blue, 
				but not as bad as Hamshakals! If kids go to watch the movie, however couples; 
				it is a Sunday so go out there and be sure to catch this movie.

There are times when you get trapped with a lot of trauma due to exams and believe me, everyone has been there!
