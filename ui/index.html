				   <p>We all know what terrific actors both Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan are. Be it ‘Dear Zindagi’ or ‘Badlapur’, they sure do nail their acting skills. Both of them started off with ‘The Student of the Year’, and they sure have come far. Both of them starred together in ‘Humpty Sharma ki Dulhania’ and swooned the audience with romance. If you think you will not get to see this awesome duo on the silver screen for a long time; you are mistaken!

Both of them are back with a bang in the movie ‘Badrinath ki Dulhania’ which is produced by Karan Johar under Dharma Productions banner.</p>

Varun Dhawan plays the role of Badrinath in the movie (The hero, we think). You will also get to see the talent of Guahar Khan in the same movie as Suzy.

As sources have confirmed, this movie is a love story between Badrinath and Vaidehi, the latter being played by none other than Alia Bhatt.

In one of his recent interviews, Varun Dhawan has also revealed that this film has a dark love story. The movie will surely have unexpected twists and turns. We all cannot wait to see them both of the silver screen can we!?

Not much of the movie has been released, but the teaser has indeed come. Here’s the link, and by the looks of it, it will surely bring out gales of laughter in the theatre.
