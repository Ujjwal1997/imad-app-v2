		<sub-topic>Wish I Had Never Known You!</sub-topic>
Have you ever wished you wouldn’t have met that one person? The one who came into your life out of nowhere and flipped it upside down and walked away like nothing ever happened.

<p>
If you have ever felt these emotions. Here’s something I am sure you’d relate to:

 

I wish I had never known you.

And all the things you told me,

I wish I never believed they were true.

———————————————————————

I got way too attached to you.

And, when I fell so hard,

You pushed me away to rue.

———————————————————————

I’m glad I have come out of it now.

And only if I had known how,

I wouldn’t have been such a frau.

———————————————————————

All this time I cursed myself.

For crawling back to you in the time of need,

When all I ever asked for was your help.

———————————————————————

I don’t hate you for all what you’ve done to me.

The truth is, I can’t thank you enough,

Because you have set me free.

———————————————————————

And even if there was some other way out,

I won’t have asked for it.

After all, you were such a knout.

———————————————————————

The Universe is keeping an eye on you.

And one day you shall repent what you’ve done,

Because believe it or not, karma spares none.

	Oh I wanna do something!!

Do you ever get bored and don’t have any idea what to do with your time? Do you feel the urge to do something but you have no idea what you want to do? This poetic expression is something which would surely make you relate to the situation you are in!

Here it goes : –

Oh I wanna do something I don’t know what yet,
Sometimes I feel its so better to be a poet,
Letting my heart out and not making the pillow wet,
I have this urge to make it big I am going for the biggest bet!!
One moment I want to fly away and move around the world,
Other moment I want to come back and be a homely bird,
I want to scream, shout and party all night,
Then I go crazy for all the unfinished sights,
Oh I wanna do something I don’t know what yet!
This feeling is a want and not a need,
To be outstanding not likely a greed,
To explore and move with the most fluid flow,
And then again i wanna be calm become slow,
Oh I wanna do something I don’t know what yet!
Forcing myself to think about things which are happening good in life,
Yet being trapped in the memories and the days behind,
One moment I wanna see you and miss you so bad,
And suddenly I think of few things and get mad,
Oh I wanna do something I don’t know what yet!
There is no peace in the silence I have,
Do I really wanna go in the crowd to feel alive,
The urge is to take bigger risk and look for adventurous night,
But I would be happy to be in your arms right now tight,
Oh I wanna do something I don’t know what yet!
This curiosity to do more is making me wild,
I sometimes feel I wish I could be mild,
This rigid routine and packed schedules,
I love them all as they don’t let me feel morning blues,
This got me thinking to be a bit relaxed in a row,
Oh I wanna be with you for this awesome show,
Nothing can be more good to be together,
And have the comfort when we talk!
